<h1 id="atomicpatternlibrary-gravproject">Atomic Pattern Library - GRAV project</h1>

<p>This project is the mixture of two things I am extremely passionate about; <a href="https://getgrav.org" title="Get GRAV - the best Flat-file CMS platform">GRAV</a> and Pattern Libraries.</p>

<p>The pattern library is a base framework for you to be able to take a running start at implementing a comprehensive and well thought out system for identifying and communicating patterns and their interactions with your design and development teams.</p>

<p><strong>Why Atomic?</strong></p>

<p>Atomic design is methodology for creating design systems. There are five distinct levels in atomic design: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates and Pages. This structure creates a system of clearly defined relationships in terms that are easy to understand.</p>

<p>For more info on Atomic Design, <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" title="Atomic Web Design">checkout what Brad Frost has to say about it</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Adding GRAV to the mix</strong></p>

<p>Grav is a <strong>Fast</strong>, <strong>Simple</strong>, and <strong>Flexible</strong>, file-based Web-platform. There is <strong>Zero</strong> installation required. Just extract the ZIP archive, and you are already up and running. It follows similar principles to other flat-file CMS platforms, but has a different design philosophy than most. Grav comes with a powerful <strong>Package Management System</strong> to allow for simple installation and upgrading of plugins and themes, as well as simple updating of Grav itself.</p>

<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting started</h2>

<p>So you want to do this? Great, start by either cloning this repo of forking it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Clone the <a href="https://github.com/retsoced/grav-pattern-library-template">Pattern library repository</a> to a folder in the webroot of your server, e.g. <code>~/webroot/grav</code>. Launch a <strong>terminal</strong> or <strong>console</strong> and navigate to the webroot folder:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="```">   $ cd ~/webroot
   $ git clone git@github.com:retsoced/grav-pattern-library-template.git

</code></pre>

<p>I have installed a base selection of <a href="https://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins">plugins</a> to try and make the pattern library as useful as possible, and they are the following:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://github.com/getgrav/grav-plugin-simplesearch">Simplesearch</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The theme is a custom theme built using Sass and Simple Grid. Using Simple Grid enables the site to have a modern responsive grid system behind the scenes, but it&#8217;s also extremely well built, supported and lightweight. The styles are broken up into groups:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>common</strong> : shared styles for the entire site, theme and patterns.</li>
<li><strong>patterns</strong> : specific definitions for <strong>just</strong> the patterns. This will help you keep track of where all of your interactions live and keep the water running between the patterns and the theme clean and clear.</li>
<li><strong>theme</strong> : custom styles for just the theme. The theme is targeted through the cascade keeping things broken out into clear partials using a component based approach.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything is downloaded and installed for you to make it easy to get started, so you just need to make sure your local environment has at least PHP 5.6 (7 is a far better choice) installed and running, and that your file/folder permissions are setup correctly. For more information on getting GRAV up and running checkout their <a href="https://learn.getgrav.org/basics/installation">installation guide</a>.</p>

<h4 id="devnote:">Dev note:</h4>

<p>I don&#8217;t have Gulp setup and running yet to make the local webserver run automatically or to compile the JavaScript or Sass yet. I use <a href="https://codekitapp.com/">Codekit</a> to compile the dependency files and libsass to compile the styles into the <code>/user/themes/patterlibrary/css</code> folder. That integration is coming in the next release.</p>

<hr />

<ol>
<li>Install the <strong>plugin</strong> and <strong>theme dependencies</strong> by using the <a href="https://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-cli">Grav CLI application</a> <code>bin/grav</code>:</li>
</ol>

<pre><code class="```">   $ cd ~/webroot/grav
   $ bin/grav install

</code></pre>
